Exploratory Data Analysis of FIFA 2021 Players (18,979 records, 77 features)

Cleaned and standardized messy features (monetary values, physical measures, star ratings) for analysis.

Engineered new metrics (growth potential = POT − OVA) and identified undervalued “hidden gems” among young players.

Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses with Python (pandas, matplotlib), producing insights on age-performance trends, positional skill clusters, and wage/value inefficiencies.

Delivered actionable conclusions on talent development and market valuation patterns.
